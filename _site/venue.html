<h2 id="workshop-venue">Workshop venue</h2>

<p>The workshop will take place in <a href="https://singapore.amarahotels.com/">Amara Hotel Singapore</a>, located in the Singapore city center. It is within walking distance to many points of interest such as Singapore’s Chinatown, the Merlion Park by Marina Bay, or the Central Business District, and within a short bus or train ride away to most other attractions.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

<h3 id="by-taxi">By taxi</h3>

<p>The most convenient way to reach the conference venue from the airport is by taxi, which can be taken from designated taxi stands at each terminal. A trip to Amara hotel should cost up to S$35–40 and take no longer than half an hour.</p>

<p>Depending on your time of arrival, the taxi stands at the airport may be crowded. It is usually much faster to book a taxi through a ride-hailing app. 
Note, however, that Uber is not available in Singapore; the local alternatives are <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/download/">Grab</a> and <a href="https://www.gojek.com/sg/">Gojek</a>, both of which accept international payment cards.</p>

<h3 id="by-public-transport">By public transport</h3>

<p>Amara Singapore can also be reached from Changi Airport by the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT). The easiest way is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take the East West line (green line) from Changi Airport. At Tanah Merah station, you will need to change trains across the platform to continue the journey.</li>
  <li>Get off at Tanjong Pagar station. The hotel is one-minute walk from Exit A of the station.</li>
</ol>

<p>       <br />
Single-journey tickets can be purchased by cash or card at each MRT station, and prepaid Ez-link cards are available at the Changi Airport station. Alternatively, all of Singapore’s local trains and buses accept contactless Mastercard and Visa credit/debit cards, including international ones. They can be used to tap in and tap out just like a public transport card.</p>

<p>Public transport trips within Singapore can be planned with Google Maps or <a href="https://citymapper.com/singapore?set_region=sg-singapore">Citymapper</a>.</p>
