We are pleased to announce the workshop "Quantum resources: from mathematical foundations to operational characterisation", to take place in Singapore from 31st August to 3rd September 2020.

The workshop is concerned with the theoretical investigation of quantum resources, and in particular on bridging the gap between the abstract mathematical description of resource theories and the protocols for their practical exploitation.

It will consist of invited talks by experts in various aspects of quantum resource theories as well as contributed talks, poster sessions, and extended discussion sessions.
