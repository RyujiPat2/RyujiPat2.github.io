Please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsOV5ieUTZIofQRVp8A8HvKMuVfPOz_whRD3sjzpgzI6YXgg/viewform?usp=sf_link) (Google Account needed) to submit either **arXiv reference and one paragraph abstract (+ publication details, if available)**, or **1-page abstract that briefly explains the background/motivation and main results of the work**. Authors are encouraged to include a copy of the full technical paper (either as a pdf or simply as an open-access link), but work-in-progress submissions without a full manuscript will also be considered. 

The submission deadline is **August 31, 2023 (AoE time)**.

Talks and posters will be selected by the workshop organizers based on the relevance of the topic and the significance of the results. Please note that we will not provide referee feedback upon notification, as the organizing committee is small and will need to be focusing on planning other aspects of the event. We appreciate your understanding. 

A list of accepted talks will be available on the conference website at a future date. We will contact presenters once the list is ready.
